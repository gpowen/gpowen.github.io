# Progress Report 1: Data

[CSV: #MeToo Tweets](knowledgemining/MeToo_tweets.csv)

- Data collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohamadalhasan/metoo-tweets-dataset)
- ~15,000 tweets over a 1 to 2 day period in 2019
- Primary variable of interest is, of course, "Tweet" being that this is a text analysis
- Basic frequencies in addition to associations (n-grams), and hopefully sentiment analysis will be covered
- Also extremely interested in pursuing STM in R, currently learning from [these](https://juliasilge.com/blog/sherlock-holmes-stm/) [blogs](https://juliasilge.com/blog/evaluating-stm/). I don't expect to be terribly proficient here as I am beginning down this path late in the process, but I think it's important to try.
